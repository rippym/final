<title> What fills me up fastest, and another problem</title>
    <Body>
    <p> With Halal food that fills around 80% but requires half my money and I normally dont go over 40% of my current balance.
        With Chinese food it makes me a tad slugish and sleepyl however it fills me up and does help clam my nerves, odd I know.
        With Checkers ehhh its pretty greasy and high in calories, super delicious yes but it doesn't fill me up to be honest.
        </p>
   <p> Oh yeah before I forget I also need to save at least half of my money to get my mentor a special gift for our one month anniversary.So uhh I'll also need your help with that as well.</p> 
   <p> I already have most of the money saved up for a cute necklace but im missing another 5$ for her gift.</p> 
        <p> So what should I go with?</p>
