<title> What to buy for Lunch </title>
    <body>
    <p>I have a problem, currently I have 10 dollars with me but I cannot for the life of me decide what to buy for lunch </p>
        
        <p> I have three different options, I can buy either chinese food for $4.50, or halal food for $5 or Checkers for $4.25 the problem is I only have 30 minutes to eat lunch and get back to school what should I do?</p>
        
        <p> It would take me around 7 minutes to get halal food, 15 minutes to get to checkers, and 12 minutes to get to the chinese place, it also takes 5 minutes for all three locations for me to get my order which should I get?</p>
