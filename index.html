    <h1>Digital literacy</h1>

<p>In todays ever changing economy and job market the fine arts of digital and graphic design are of the utmost important today. "To put it very simply: computer science (CS) is the future of the job market. By 2024, there will be a projected 4.4 million jobs in computer and information technology occupations. Thatâ€™s a 12 percent growth rate from 2014, a rate outpacing that of all other occupations. Computer-oriented jobs are also the number one source of all new wages in the US and are demanded four times more than any other occupation according to Cameron Wilson, COO and VP of Government Relations for Code.org." by New America Weekly. </p>

<p> The fine arts of elemental and graphical design are diffuclt to learn but the pay off is very well. The average Graphic Design worker earns around 40k per year when they start out, while most jobs dont pay as highly. The annual salary for a lower class is considerd anywhere under $35,000 while midle class is above that to near $105,000.
