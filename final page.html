    <body> I only have half an hour for lunch and my three options vary on cost, time and how much it fills me up.</body>
    <p> I have to save at least half of my money to buy my mentor a gift for our anniversary so I have to make sure to stay on budget with the limited funds I have.</p>
    <p> So what should I have for lunch?</p>

    <p>Hmmm you shouldnt be here unless you've already figured out the answer to my problem but heres the solution to my dilema!</p>
    <p>  Hmm chinese food would be the best answer to be honest.
    You see if it takes 12 minutes to get to the chinese place and 5 minutes to get my order and 12 more minutes to get back I would have spent $4.50 saving me over half my current balence, I would've used up 29 minutes out of the 30 so its cutting it pretty close!</p> 
    <p> Had I gone to get halal food I would've been back in class in merely 19 minutes but then I wouldn't have had the money to buy my mentor her gift.
    And getting to checkers would take way to long, its cheapest yes but it won't fill me up and it would take 35 minutes to get back to class at that rate which would make me late by that point.</p>
